<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Started in this company as a junior and learned many skills like panel wiring, troubleshooting, commissioning and programming.
  In my experience the key skill I worked on is programming PLC's.

<p>After entering into programming in my present company, I got interest in writing logics. After that slowly with the help of my friends who are working in Software fields,
   I got interest in going to Software field. They showed me how its done in their field and explained me what the work is. With their help I got interest
in changing my filed from Electrical Automation Engineer to Software Web Developer and I enrolled in Udemy for Full Stack Web Development course by Dr. Angela Yu.</p>
